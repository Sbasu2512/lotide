/*
Fn will take in two parameters as well:
The array to work with
The callback (which Lodash calls "predicate")
The function will return a "slice of the array with elements taken from the beginning." It should keep going until the callback/predicate returns a truthy value.
To keep things simple, the callback should only be provided one value: The item in the array.
Implement takeUntil which will keep collecting items from a provided array until the callback provided returns a truthy value.
