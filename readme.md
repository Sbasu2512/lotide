# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @sayantan2512/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@sayantan2512/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual`: it takes in two arrays and prints an appropriate message to the console.
* `assertEqual`: checks if both input and output have a perfect match.
* `head`: returns the element in 0th index of the given array.
* `tail`: returns the rest of the array after removing the 0th index element.
* `middle`: returns the middle element of an array.
* `map`: it will return a new array based on the results of the callback function.
* `min`: returns the lowest number in an array.
* `sum`: it take node arguments and returns thier sum.
* `assertObjectsEqual`: detects that two objects are equal.
* `countLetters`: returns a count of each of the letters in that sentence.
* `countOnly`: it takes in an array and an object & return an object containing counts of everything that the input object listed.
* `eqArrays`: it takes in two arrays and returns true or false, based on a perfect match.
* `eqObjects`: it takes in two objects and returns true or false, based on a perfect match.
* `findKey`: it takes in an object and a callback func and returns the first key for which the callback returns a truthy value. If no key is found, then it returns undefined.
* `findKeyByValue`: it takes in an object and a value and returns the key for that value.
* `flatten`: it takes in an array containing elements including nested arrays of elements, and returns a "flattened" version of the array.
* `letterPositions`: returns all the indices (zero-based positions) in the string where each character is found.
