## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual`: it takes in two arrays and prints an appropriate message to the console.
* `assertEqual`: checks if both input and output have a perfect match.
* `head`: returns the element in 0th index of the given array.
* `tail`: returns the rest of the array after removing the 0th index element.
* `middle`: returns the middle element of an array.
*`map`: Our map function will take in two arguments 1.An array to map 2. A callback function. The map function will return a new array based on the results of the callback function.
